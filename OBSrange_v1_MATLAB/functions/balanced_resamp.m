function [ dataout, indxs, datamat ] = balanced_resamp( data,niter )
%[ indxs ] = balanced_resampling( data,niter )
%   function to get indices for balanced resampling of data for
%   bootstrapping
%
% INPUTS:
%   data    = data vector that will be randomly resampled
%   niter   = number of iterations in bootstrap
%   
% OUTPUTS:
%  dataout  = Output data matrix with random resampling applied along the
%              columns. (Ndata x niter)
%   indxs   = Ndata x niter matrix, each column of which is a set of
%              indices from the original dataset. Each index appears a
%              total of precisely niter times in the whole matrix
%  datamat  = Data matrix before random resampling. Same size as indxs
