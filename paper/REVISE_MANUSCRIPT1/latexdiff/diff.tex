\section{Introduction}
The last two decades have seen a sea change in the longevity, distribution, and sophistication of temporary ocean bottom seismic installations. The proliferation of ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) deployments has opened up new possibilities for understanding the ocean basins \citep[e.g.][]{Lin2016,Takeo2016}, continental margins \citep[e.g.][]{Janiszewski2015,Hawley2016,Lynner2017,Eilon2017}, and even inland submerged environments \citep[e.g.][]{Accardo2017}. 

However, even straightforward OBS installations present several unique challenges. Foremost among these is the inability to directly measure the location of the sensor at the seafloor. Precise knowledge of station location is essential for almost all seismological analysis. While the location of the ship is known at the time of deployment, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{OBS instruments may drift by }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{as OBS instruments sink they may drift }\DIFaddend up to hundreds of meters from this point due to ocean currents and a non-streamlined basal profile. 

For broadband OBS deployments, it has long been accepted practice to conduct an acoustic survey in order to triangulate the position of the instrument \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[e.g.,][]{Creager1982}}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . To accomplish this, ships send non-directional acoustic pulses \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(``pings'') }\DIFaddend into the water column. These are received by the OBS transponder which sends its own acoustic pulse in response. The time elapsed between the ship sending and receiving acoustic pulses is proportional to distance, which (for known ship location) may be used to locate the instrument. It is common for this analysis to be conducted by technicians at OBS instrument centers and provided latterly to PIs and data centers as station metadata. Some codes are proprietary intellectual property of the instrument centers, and others are available for a license fee. 

However, standard station location algorithms to date are lacking in certain respects. Water sound speed and even water depth are often assumed \textit{a priori}. Commonly, no \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{correction is made }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{corrections are made to account }\DIFaddend for the movement of the ship \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{between sending and receiving acoustic signals, the horizontal offset between GPS and transponder location, or ray bending due to refraction through the water column}\DIFaddend . Robust uncertainty analysis, which would allow practitioners to gauge potential location errors, is either not conducted or communicated.

We present \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an open-source }\DIFdelend OBS locator software for use by the marine geophysics community \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that can account for ship velocity, GPS-transponder offset, and ray bending}\DIFaddend . Our efficient inversion algorithm provides station location in three dimensions and solves for depth-averaged water sound speed. We use statistical tools to provide robust uncertainties on the instrument location as well as water velocity. The code is available in both MATLAB and Python to promote accessibility (see Data and Resources). In this article\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend we present the theory behind our algorithm, validate the inversion using synthetic testing, compare its accuracy with a previous tool, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{demonstrate its utility with real data. Finally, we use the tool to }\DIFdelend carefully test a variety of survey patterns \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and identify an optimal geometry }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{identifying optimal geometries }\DIFaddend for accurately recovering all model parameters, including the trade-off between depth and water velocity. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Finally, we demonstrate its utility with real data from the 2018 Young Pacific ORCA (OBS Research into Convecting Asthenosphere) Experiment \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Gaherty2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
, revealing a network-wide clockwise-rotation that resembles a cyclonic mesoscale gyre. }\DIFaddend This study represents a first \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{open-source tool for accurately locating instruments on the seafloor as well as a }\DIFaddend thorough investigation of survey \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{geometry }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{geometries }\DIFaddend that will serve to inform future OBS deployments.

%% ---------------- ALGORITHM ---------------- %%
\section{Algorithm }


\subsection{The forward problem}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Here we outline the forward and inverse problems for inverting acoustic ranging data for instrument location on the seafloor following \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citet{Creager1982}}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend We wish to locate an instrument which rests at unknown position and depth on the ocean floor (Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon}). Taking the drop coordinates as the center of a Cartesian coordinate system in which $x$ is positive towards East, $y$ is positive towards North, and $z$ is positive upwards from the sea surface, the instrument lies at location $(x,y,z)$. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We account for Earth's ellipticity when converting between geodetic and local ENU coordinates using the WGS84 reference ellipsoid \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{WGS84_2000} }%DIFAUXCMD
and standard coordinate transformations \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep[i.e.,][]{Hoffmann_Wellenhof_2001}}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend The time taken for an acoustic pulse to travel from the ship\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s transponder }\DIFaddend to the instrument and back is a function of the sound speed in water ($V_P$), and the location of the ship, as well as the ``turn-around time'' ($\tau$) that corresponds to the (fixed) processing time between the OBS transducer receiving a ping and sending its response. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If the shipboard transponder and GPS are not co-located and their relative positions are known, a heading-dependent correction is applied to the GPS position to precisely locate the transponder. }\DIFaddend In detail, we can account for the possibility that if the ship is under way, its position changes between sending and receiving pings. Thus, the total travel time, $T$, is: 

\begin{equation}
T = \frac{r_s + r_r}{V_P} + \tau \,, \label{eq:forward_send_receive}
\end{equation}
where \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for a straight-ray approximation,
}\DIFaddend 

\begin{align}
	r_s &= \sqrt{(x_s - x)^2 + (y_s - y)^2 + z^2}\\
	r_r &= \sqrt{(x_r - x)^2 + (y_r - y)^2 + z^2} \,.
\end{align}

Subscript ``$s$'' indicates the ship\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s transponder }\DIFaddend sending a ping and ``$r$'' indicates the ship\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{'s transponder }\DIFaddend receiving the OBS's response. These positions are related by the velocity ($\mathbf{u} = (u_x,u_y,0)$) of the ship, which is estimated from the survey data by differencing neighboring survey points:

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} x_s\\y_s\\0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_r\\y_r\\0 \end{pmatrix} - T\begin{pmatrix} u_x\\u_y\\0 \end{pmatrix} \,.
\end{equation}

It follows that, to a close approximation,

\begin{align}
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \begin{split}
%DIFDELCMD < r_s &\approx r_r - T \left(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{r}}_r \right)\\
%DIFDELCMD < 	&= r_r - \delta r \,,
%DIFDELCMD < \end{split}	
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{split}
r_s &\approx r_r - \left(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{r}}_r \right) T\\
	&= r_r - \delta r \,,
\end{split}	
\DIFaddend \end{align}

where $\mathbf{\hat{r}}_r$ is the unit-vector pointing from the instrument to the ship at the time of receiving. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{If we know the distance $\delta r$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{By calculating the distance $\delta r = \left(\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{\hat{r}}_r \right) T$}\DIFaddend , we can account for the send-receive timing offset related to a change in the ship's position by computing a correction time, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\delta T = \delta r/V_P$. 
Substituting this into }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\delta T_{\text{dopp}} = \delta r/V_P$, which will be positive if GPS coordinates correspond to the receive location and negative if they correspond to the send location. 
}

\DIFadd{We can also account for ray-bending due to refraction through the water column by calculating an additional correction time, $\delta T_{\text{bend}}$, that is the difference in two-way travel time between the straight-ray approximation calculated through the depth-averaged water column and the value calculated by ray tracing through a 1D sound-speed profile. A velocity profile automatically is selected from the 2009 World Ocean Atlas database decadal averages (see Data and Resources) for the appropriate survey location and month (determined by GPS location and time stamps in the data file). Alternatively, a user can specify their own velocity profile. Rays are traced from the surface down to $\pm$200~m about the nominal drop depth (}\textit{\DIFadd{e.g.}}\DIFadd{, from multibeam data) and at a range of distances out to 4~km offset, producing an evenly spaced lookup-table of $\delta T_{\text{bend}}$ corrections as a function of depth and offset. The corrections are then added to the raw travel times for the appropriate depth and offset to convert from bent to straight rays. This correction is most significant for stations in shallow water (less than $\sim$1000~m) at long offsets, in particular if there is a sharp velocity change at the thermocline, but is negligible ($<$1~ms) for deeper instruments and at shorter offsets (see Figures~S1--S2, available in the electronic supplement to this article). With the addition of these corrections to }\DIFaddend equation (\ref{eq:forward_send_receive}), \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we have
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the two-way travel time is given by:
}\DIFaddend 

\begin{equation}
T + \delta T = \frac{2 r_r}{V_P} + \tau \,\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend \label{eq:forward}
\end{equation}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{where $\delta T = \delta T_{\text{dopp}} + \delta T_{\text{bend}}$.
}

\DIFaddend \subsection{The inverse problem}

If the ship location and travel times between the OBS and ship are known, but the position of the OBS is not, equation (\ref{eq:forward}) can be thought of as a non-linear inverse problem, of the form $ \mathbf{d} = g(\mathbf{m})$, where $g(\mathbf{m})$ represents the forward-model. In practice, a limited survey radius makes it difficult to uniquely solve for $z$, $V_P$, and $\tau$. Since turn-around time is a parameter provided by the transponder manufacturer, we choose to fix $\tau$ in order to reduce unnecessary trade-offs in the inversion and more precisely resolve depth and water velocity. Thus, the model contains four parameters: $\mathbf{m} = \{x,y,z,V_P\}$. The data, $\mathbf{d}$, are a vector of corrected travel times, $T+\delta T$ (note that $\delta T$ is itself a function of $\mathbf{m}$; this will be adjusted iteratively \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{during the inversion}\DIFaddend ). Uncorrected travel-time residuals predicted from the starting model with magnitude $>$500~ms are considered anomalous and are removed before beginning the inversion. This type of problem can be solved iteratively using Newton's method \citep{Menke2018}:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{k+1} = \mathbf{m}_k + \left[\mathbf{G}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{G}\right]^{-1} \mathbf{G}^{\text{T}} \left(\mathbf{d} - g(\mathbf{m}_k)\right) \,,
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{G}$ is a matrix of partial derivatives: $G_{ij} = \partial d_i/\partial m_j$, as follows:

%\begin{align*}
%\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x_O} &= 
%	-\frac{2 x_O}{V_P} \left( (x_i - x_O)^2 + (y_i - y_O)^2 + z_O^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\\
%\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial y_O} &= 
%	-\frac{2 y_O}{V_P} \left( (x_i - x_O)^2 + (y_i - y_O)^2 + z_O^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\\
%\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial z_O} &= 
%	\frac{2 z_O}{V_P} \left( (x_i - x_O)^2 + (y_i - y_O)^2 + z_O^2 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\\	
%\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial V_P} &= 
%	-\frac{2}{V_P^2} \left( (x_i - x_O)^2 + (y_i - y_O)^2 + z_O^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\	
%\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial \tau} &= 1\\	
%\end{align*}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial x} &= 
	-\frac{2 (x_i - x)}{V_P \, r_i}\\
\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial y} &= 
	-\frac{2 (y_i - y)}{V_P \, r_i} \\
\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial z} &= 
	\frac{2 z}{V_P \, r_i} \\	
\frac{\partial d_i}{\partial V_P} &= 
	-\frac{2 \, r_i}{V_P^2} \,.
\end{align}

We use the drop coordinates and water depth (if available from multibeam) as a starting model, along with $V_P = 1500$ m/s. We fix $\tau =$13 ms, which is the default value for all ITC and ORE Offshore and EdgeTech transponders and underwater communications transducers (Ernest Aaron, \textit{pers. comm.}). There is some degree of trade-off between the water depth and the water velocity. Simplistically, if all survey measurements are made at a constant distance from the station (\textit{e.g.}, if the survey is a circle centered on the station) then these parameters co-vary perfectly. As a result, the inverse problem is ill-posed and, like all mixed-determined problems, requires regularization. We damp perturbations in $V_P$, which is not likely to vary substantially from 1500 m/s, and implement global norm damping to stabilize the inversion:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F} = 
	\left[\begin{matrix}
	\mathbf{G}\\\mathbf{H}\\\epsilon^{1/2}\mathbf{I}
	\end{matrix}\right] \,,
	\hspace{15mm}
	\mathbf{f} = 
	\left[\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \begin{matrix}
%DIFDELCMD < 	\mathbf{d} - g(\mathbf{m})\\0\\\mathbf{0}
%DIFDELCMD < 	\end{matrix}%%%
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \begin{matrix}
	\mathbf{d} - g(\mathbf{m})\\\mathbf{0}\\\mathbf{0}
	\end{matrix}\DIFaddend \right] \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the $4\times 4$ identity matrix, $\epsilon = 10^{-10}$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\mathbf{H}=\left( 0, 0, 0, \gamma_{V_P} \right)$, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\mathbf{H}=\text{diag}\left( \gamma_{x}, \gamma_{y}, \gamma_{z}, \gamma_{V_P} \right)$, $\gamma_{x}=\gamma_{y}=\gamma_{z}=0$, }\DIFaddend and $\gamma_{V_P} = 5\times10^{-8}$. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The equation to be solved }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These values for the damping parameters were determined by trial and error and are the defaults in the code. They have been tested on many different survey geometries, and thus, should require very little tuning for most applications but can easily be altered by the user. The damped solution using Newton's method }\DIFaddend becomes:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{m}_{k+1} = \mathbf{m}_k + \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{F} \right]^{-1} \mathbf{F}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{f} \,. \label{eq:inverse}
\end{equation}

This equation is solved iteratively, until the root-mean-squared (RMS) of the misfit, $e$, (where $e = T+\delta T-g(\mathbf{m})$) decreases by less than 0.1 ms compared to the previous iteration. This criterion is typically reached after $\sim$4 iterations. 

\subsection{Errors and uncertainty}
In order to estimate the uncertainty in our model, we perform 1,000 bootstrap iterations on survey travel-time data with a balanced resampling approach \citep{Davison1986}. In each iteration the algorithm inverts a random sub-sample of the true data set, with the constraint that all data points are eventually sampled an equal number of times. This approach reduces variance in bias and achieves robust uncertainty estimates in fewer iterations compared to traditional uniform sampling approaches \citep{Hung2011}. Although balanced resampling provides empirical probability distributions of possible model parameters, it does not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{straightforwardly offer }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{offer straightforward }\DIFaddend quantitative estimates of model uncertainty because the goodness of data fit for each run in the bootstrap iteration is ignored (that is, within each iteration, a model is found that best fits the randomly sub-sampled dataset, but in the context of the full dataset, the fit and uncertainty of that particular model may be relatively poor). For more statistically robust uncertainty estimates, we perform a grid search over ($x,y,z$) within a region centered on the bootstrapped mean location, 
$(x_{{\text{best}}},y_{{\text{best}}},z_{{\text{best}}})$. For each perturbed location, ($x^{\prime},y^{\prime},z^{\prime}$), we use an F-test to compare the norm of the data prediction error to the minimum error, assuming they each have a $\chi^2$ distribution. The effective number of degrees of freedom, $\nu$ can be approximated as 

\begin{equation}
\nu \approx N_f - \text{tr}(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{F}_{\text{inv}}) \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{F}_{\text{inv}}= \left[ \mathbf{F}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{F} \right]^{-1} \mathbf{F}^{\text{T}}$, $N_f$ is the length of vector $\mathbf{f}$, and $\text{tr}()$ denotes the trace. Using the F-test, we can evaluate the statistical probability of the true OBS location departing from our best-fitting location by a given value. 

Some care is required in implementing this grid search. Since $z$ covaries with $V_P$, varying $z$ \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{quickly }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{alone }\DIFaddend leads to large errors in data prediction as $|z^{\prime}-z_{{\text{best}}}|$ increases if one holds $V_P$ fixed. As a result, it appears as if the gradient in the error surface is very sharp in the $z$ direction, implying this parameter is very well resolved; in fact, the opposite is true. We find the empirical covariance of $z$ and $V_P$ by performing principal component analysis on the bootstrap model solutions. We then use the largest eigenvector to project perturbations in $z$ within the grid search onto $V_P$, adjusting velocity appropriately as we progress through the grid search. 

\subsection{Model resolution and trade-offs}
In order to quantitatively compare various survey configurations and assess their ability to recover the true model parameters, we calculate the model resolution, $\mathbf{R}$, and correlation, $\mathbf{C}$, matrices. The $M \times M$ model resolution matrix is given by \citep{Menke2018}:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{R} = \mathbf{G}_{\text{inv}} \mathbf{G} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{G}_{\text{inv}}= \left[ \mathbf{G}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{G} + \mathbf{H}^{\text{T}} \mathbf{H} + \epsilon\mathbf{I} \right]^{-1} \mathbf{G}^{\text{T}}$. Since the resolution matrix depends only on the data kernel and applied damping and is thus independent of the data themselves, it reflects strongly the chosen survey geometry. Each model parameter is independently resolved when $\mathbf{R}=\mathbf{I}$. Since perfect resolution occurs when $\mathbf{R}$ is equal to the identity matrix, off-diagonal elements (or ``spread'') indicate poor model resolution and trade-offs between the respective parameters. The spread of the model resolution matrix is defined as the squared $L_2$ norm of the difference between $\mathbf{R}$ and the identity matrix \citep{Menke2018}:

\begin{equation}
\text{spread}(\mathbf{R}) = \sum_{i=1}^M\sum_{j=1}^M \left[ R_{ij}-\delta_{ij}\right]^2 \,,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Dirac delta function. Therefore, model resolution is perfect when $\text{spread}(\mathbf{R})=0$.

The model correlation matrix (or unit covariance matrix), $\mathbf{C}$, describes the mapping of error between model parameters. Given the covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\text{m}} = \mathbf{G}_{\text{inv}} \mathbf{G}_{\text{inv}}^{\text{T}}$, the correlation matrix is defined as:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{D}^{-1}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\text{m}}\mathbf{D}^{-1} \,,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{D} = \text{diag}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\text{m}})^{1/2}$ is the diagonal matrix of model parameter standard deviations. The off diagonal elements of this unitless matrix indicate how model parameters trade off with one another in the inversion, with negative numbers indicating negatively correlated parameters and vice versa.

\section{Results }
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{We summarize the results of synthetic testing and application to a real data set in order to demonstrate the robust features of }\textit{\DIFadd{OBSrange}}\DIFadd{. All synthetic tests shown in this section were carried out at 5000~m depth unless noted otherwise (see electronic supplement for results of tests at different water depths). This depth is similar to the average depth of the Young Pacific ORCA Experiment, where the tool is applied in section~\ref{sec:PacificArray_deployment}, allowing for easier comparison. Furthermore, the magnitude of uncertainties generally decrease for shallow water (see Figures~S7--S8, available in the electronic supplement to this article), and therefore, uncertainties reported here represent upper bounds for the algorithm.

\subsection{Demonstration on synthetic data} \label{Demonstration on synthetic data}
We validated our algorithm by checking that it correctly recovers the (known) location of synthetic test stations. Synthetic two-way travel times were computed by interpolating the ship's position (traveling at an average velocity of 8~kn) within a fixed survey pattern at one-minute intervals, sending straight-line rays to the instrument and back, and adding the turn-around time. This travel time includes the change in ship's position between sending and receiving; since the position of the ship at the time it receives the acoustic pulse is itself dependent on the travel time, in constructing the synthetic dataset we iterated on this value until the time and position converged to give an error of \mbox{$<10^{-6}$ s}. Only the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{location }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{two-way travel time, ship location, }\DIFaddend and absolute time at the moment the ship receives the acoustic pulse \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{was }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{were }\DIFaddend recorded for the inversion, mimicking data obtained during real surveys using equipment such as an EdgeTech deck box. We then added Gaussian random noise to the resultant travel times using a standard deviation of 4 ms, to account for measurement noise, errors in ship GPS location, and local changes in water velocity. Lastly, we randomly dropped out $\sim$20\% of the travel time data points, simulating the occasional null return from the acoustic survey. This testing procedure was designed to mimic the idiosyncrasies of real acoustic surveys as closely as possible. 

Figure\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:one_sta_synth} shows the result of an inversion at a single station \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{at 5000~m depth using a 1~Nm radius ``}\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}}\DIFadd{'' survey geometry}\DIFaddend . For this inversion, we included \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend correction for a Doppler shift introduced by the ship's motion, estimating ship velocity\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, as one would for real data, }\DIFaddend from the timing and location of survey points. The inversion was successful in locating the OBS station: the estimated location is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3.02 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3.0 }\DIFaddend m from the the true location (Figure\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend \ref{fig:one_sta_synth}). This misfit is extremely small in the context of $\sim$320~m of drift, a survey radius of $\sim$1800~m (1~Nm), and a water depth of $\sim$5300~m. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moreover, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend true location falls well within the uncertainty bounds estimated from the F-test and the bootstrap analysis. 

In order to obtain statistics on the general quality of the synthetic recovery, we performed this test for 10,000 synthetic OBS stations, as follows: For each iteration, a synthetic station location was determined relative to a fixed drop point by drawing x- and y-drifts from zero-centered Gaussian distributions with standard deviations of 100 m (only in rare cases are stations thought to drift further than $\sim$200 m). The depth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, turn-around time, }\DIFdelend and average water velocity were similarly randomly selected, with mean values of 5000 m \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, 13 ms, }\DIFdelend and 1500 m/s and standard deviations of 50 m \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, 3 ms, }\DIFdelend and 10 m/s, respectively. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The known turn-around time is perfectly accounted for. }\DIFaddend For tests of the basic location algorithm, we held the survey geometry constant, using the \textit{PACMAN} configuration with a radius of 1~Nm (see Section~\ref{sec:surv_geom_tests}). 

The results of these tests show that on average our inversion is highly successful in correctly locating the OBS stations. The mean location errors in the x-, y-, and z-directions were 0.038 m, 0.152 m, and -0.599 m respectively, demonstrating there was no systematic bias in the locations. The mean error in water velocity was indistinguishable from zero, showing that its estimation was also not biased. The mean absolute horizontal location error was \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.31 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.3 }\DIFaddend m, with a standard deviation of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.22 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.2 }\DIFaddend m. 95\% of the absolute horizontal station location errors were less than \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4.58 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4.6 }\DIFaddend m. There was no relationship observed between station drift (\DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{i.e.}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{i.e.}\DIFaddend , the distance between the synthetic OBS station and the drop point) and the location error, indicating that as long as stations settle within the survey bounds they will be well located. A corollary to this observation is that location estimates should not be biased by incorrectly recorded drop locations. 

We observed a strong trade-off between water velocity and depth, which was responsible for the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{somewhat }\DIFdelend larger standard error in station depth estimates, which was \mbox{9.6\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~}\DIFaddend m}. This uncertainty is likely of negligible concern for most OBS practitioners, but if precise depths are important then a survey geometry that includes more tracks towards and away from the station would be preferable (in addition to verification using acoustic echo-sounders that implement precise water-velocity profiles from XBT \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{data).

Ship velocity is estimated from the survey data by differencing neighboring survey points. In theory, this could be used to correct Doppler shifts (Figure \ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}c) in travel time (as in the synthetic tests), but we found that this correction did not substantially improve data fit for real stations and so did not apply it to this data set, although it is included as an option in the location codes. The small RMS data misfit of $\sim$1.6 ms attests to the quality of the survey measurements and the appropriateness of our relatively simple location algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}d). The southwestwards drift of \mbox{$\sim340$ m} (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_real_histograms}) demonstrates that ocean currents can substantially displace the final OBS location from their surface drop point.

\DIFdelend \subsection{Comparison to previous tools} \DIFaddbegin \label{sec:Comparison_to_previous_tools}
\DIFaddend 

We compared our location algorithm with a tool developed by engineers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{has previously been }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is commonly }\DIFaddend used to locate OBS on the seafloor. This unpublished tool, hereafter referred to as \textit{SIOgs}, performs a grid search in $x$--$y$ holding $z$ fixed at the reported drop-point depth and assuming a water velocity of 1500 m/s\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and turn-around time of 13 ms}\DIFdelend . The grid search begins with grid cells of 100$\times$100~m and iteratively reduces their size to 0.1$\times$0.1~m. In contrast to our algorithm, \textit{SIOgs} does not account for: 1) the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\delta T$ (Doppler ) correction }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Doppler correction ($\delta T_{\text{dopp}}$) }\DIFaddend due to the changing ship position between sending and receiving, 2) the ellipsoidal shape of the Earth when converting between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{latitude--longitude }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{latitude-longitude }\DIFaddend and $x$--$y$, 3) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a known GPS-transponder offset, 4) }\DIFaddend variations in $z$ and $V_p$, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{5}\DIFaddend ) automated identification and removal of low-quality travel-time data. Furthermore, \textit{SIOgs} provides no information about uncertainty or resolution of model parameters.  

To quantitatively compare our algorithm with \textit{SIOgs}, as well as the importance of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{5 }\DIFaddend additional features that our algorithm includes, we performed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{9 }\DIFaddend separate inversions of a synthetic dataset for a \textit{PACMAN} survey geometry with 1 Nm radius and 4~ms of Gaussian noise added to the travel-time data (Figure~\ref{fig:compare_tool}). For the synthetic experiment, the instrument drifted 447~m from the drop point, settling to 5050~m depth with a water velocity of 1520~m/s\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and turn-around time of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Relative to the GPS, the transponder was located 10~m closer to the ship's bow and 10~m further starboard (a horizontal distance of $\sim$}\DIFaddend 14~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{ms}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{m)}\DIFaddend . We inverted \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the synthetic data }\DIFaddend using the complete \textit{OBSrange} algorithm \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(inversion 1 in Figure~\ref{fig:compare_tool}) }\DIFaddend as well as several variants where parameters were damped or removed to assess their importance; details of the inversions including the starting models are given in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{table}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Table}\DIFaddend ~\ref{table:compare_tool}. Our algorithm estimated the horizontal position of the instrument to within $\sim$1.5~m of the true location with a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{mean }\DIFaddend data RMS misfit of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4.2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3.7}\DIFaddend ~ms, while \textit{SIOgs} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(inversion 8) }\DIFaddend located it $\sim$42~m from the true position with an RMS of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{22.8}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{19.7}\DIFaddend ~ms, far beyond the 95\% F-test contour (Figure~\ref{fig:compare_tool}a). Our algorithm recovered the true depth and water velocity to within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3}\DIFaddend ~m and 1~m/s \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, respectively, even when assuming an incorrect turn-around time of 13~ms}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on average, respectively}\DIFaddend .

The \textit{SIOgs} tool was very susceptible to anomalous travel-time data, which are a common occurrence in real survey data and are thought to result from out-of-plane acoustic reflections or multiples of earlier pulses. Inversion \textit{SIOgs no QC} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(9) }\DIFaddend included a single anomalous travel-time measurement \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2000}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4000}\DIFaddend ~ms from its true value, causing the station to be mislocated by $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{130}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{320}\DIFaddend ~m with a travel-time residual RMS of $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{193}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{383}\DIFaddend ~ms. We found that if several such erroneous travel-time data are included in the SIO inversion, a horizontal location misfit on the order of $\sim$1000~m can result. Although such outliers can be manually discarded, they could potentially be overlooked. As mentioned, our method includes a quality control step based on travel-time residuals of the starting location that removes such anomalous residuals with magnitudes $>$500 ms \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(default value in the code)}\DIFaddend .

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Inversions using our method }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{OBSrange}} \DIFadd{inversions }\DIFaddend that did not solve for $z$ and/or $V_p$ resulted in the largest instrument location errors. With depth held constant at 5000~m (\DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{Fix-Z}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{inversion 6}\DIFaddend ), the instrument was mislocated by $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8.5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{7.5}\DIFaddend ~m and water velocity underestimated by $\sim$14~m/s. Similarly, with $V_p$ held constant (\DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{Fix-$V_p$}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{inversion 5}\DIFaddend ), the instrument was located $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{9}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{11}\DIFaddend ~m from its true position, and the estimated depth was $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{70}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{72}\DIFaddend ~m too shallow. In the case where both depth and water velocity were held constant (\DIFdelbegin \textit{\DIFdel{XY-only}}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{inversion 7}\DIFaddend ), we observed a location misfit of $\sim$40~m, similar to that of the \textit{SIOgs} tool \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(8)}\DIFaddend . The strong trade-off between depth and water velocity means that one cannot be confidently recovered without also solving for the other, and failing to solve for one (or both) results in larger location errors.

\DIFdelend In addition to showing the full potential of \textit{OBSrange}, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for Earth's ellipsoidal shape when converting latitude and longitude to $x$--$y$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(inversion 3)}\DIFaddend . The travel-time residuals of \textit{SIOgs} (Figure~\ref{fig:compare_tool}b) display both a static shift from 0~ms as well as an azimuthal dependence. The shift of approximately -20~ms is a combination of the incorrectly assumed station depth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, water velocity , and turn-around time and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and water velocity and }\DIFaddend accounts for most of the data misfit. The azimuthal variation observed in the travel-time residuals of \textit{SIOgs} is due to both the incorrect horizontal location of the instrument as well as the failure to account for Earth's ellipsoidal shape when converting from geographic coordinates to $x$--$y$. Failing to account for the ellipsoid produces a 2-theta azimuthal pattern in the residuals that becomes increasingly strong as survey radius increases and at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{lower latitudes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{latitudes far from around $\pm$50$^{\circ}$, where the ellipsoid and spherical approximation converge}\DIFaddend . For this synthetic test with a survey radius of 1 Nm ($\sim$1852 m) at \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{7.5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\sim$6}\DIFaddend $^{\circ}$S, the ellipsoid produced a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\sim$10~m apparent }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{maximum apparent horizontal }\DIFaddend shift to the northern and southern ship positions \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

Correcting for this anomaly slightly improved \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{our }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend ability to accurately recover station depth and water velocity; however, it did not significantly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effect the the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{affect the }\DIFaddend horizontal location estimate, owing to the roughly symmetric survey pattern \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(i.e., the perturbation to travel times are nearly symmetric with respect to ship azimuth in Figures~S3--S4). }\DIFaddend For non-symmetric surveys, including those with a strong back-azimuthal variation in good acoustic returns, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the horizontal location bias that results }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{horizontal location biases resulting }\DIFaddend from improper ellipticity corrections \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is likely to be more significant .
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may be more significant.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Failing to account for the relative offset in shipboard GPS and transponder (with transponder located $\sim$14~m from the GPS toward the front-right of the ship) leads to biased $z$ and $V_p$ estimates (inversion 4). Instrument depth and water velocity are underestimated by $\sim$28~m and $\sim$8~m/s, respectively. The difference in transponder-to-instrument and GPS-to-instrument two-way travel times is nearly constant with ship azimuth for the }\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}} \DIFadd{configuration (see Figure~S5, available in the electronic supplement to this article) with a mean of $\sim$3.4~ms. This constant travel time offset is primarily mapped into $z$. Because the transponder is almost always further away than the GPS from the instrument in this example, this results in a $z$ estimate that is too shallow. Similarly, if the transponder had been located at the back-left of the ship, then it would have been closer than the GPS to the instrument and $z$ would be over estimated. This suggests that in principle, the GPS-transponder offset could be solved for; however, in practice there is significant trade off between GPS-transponder offset, depth, and water velocity, such that it would be difficult to resolve unless $z$ and $V_p$ are known. The horizontal uncertainties are still small ($\sim$3~m), even without this correction.
}

\DIFaddend The ``Doppler'' corrections (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\delta T$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\delta T_{\text{dopp}}$ }\DIFaddend in equation~(\ref{eq:forward})) applied to the two-way travel times provided only a very small improvement to the estimated horizontal instrument locations ($\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3.5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.7}\DIFaddend ~m improvement in mean horizontal location and $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.0}\DIFaddend ~m reduction in $r_{xy}$ RMS misfit\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{).

Because this correction term is calculated from the ship's radial velocity with respect to the instrument, it is small (magnitudes $<$1.6~ms) for the circular portions of the survey and relatively large ($\sim$6~ms) for the radial segments. Only a small portion of the }\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}} \DIFadd{survey occurs along the radial direction (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_synth}a) and therefore, these corrections tend to have a small effect on model recovery. In practice, the }\DIFaddend effectiveness of these corrections depend strongly on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{accuracy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{precision }\DIFaddend of the shipboard GPS as well as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{its position relative to the acoustic receiver.

\subsection{Exploration of survey pattern geometries} \label{sec:surv_geom_tests}

In order to evaluate which survey patterns are optimal for accurately locating instruments on the seafloor, we conducted \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{17 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{19 }\DIFaddend synthetic surveys of varying geometry and size. For these tests, we attempted to mimic real-world experimental uncertainty as closely as possible. Each parameter ($x$, $y$, $z$, $V_p$) was treated as a Gaussian random variable with a predetermined mean and standard deviation
(see Section~\ref{Demonstration on synthetic data}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{for means and standard deviations). Additionally, $\tau$ was varied with a mean value of 13~ms and standard deviation of 3~ms to simulate uncertainty in this assumed parameter. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{). }\DIFaddend For each survey configuration, we applied the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{full }\DIFaddend \textit{OBSrange} algorithm \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(including corrections for Doppler and GPS-transponder offset) }\DIFaddend to 10,000 realizations drawn from these distributions in order to fully explore the limits of each survey type. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The GPS-transponder offset is the same as in the previous section ($\sim$14~m). }\DIFaddend Synthetic data were calculated in the same way as in previous sections with $\sim$20\% of the data points randomly removed. To further simulate realistic data loss due to ``shadowing'' effects associated with topography obstructing the acoustic propagation path, we removed three sectors of data with random central azimuth and half-width standard deviation of 20$^{\circ}$ for each realization (excluding \textit{Line} surveys). All survey points $<$100~m from the drop point were retained. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The precise uncertainties and optimal survey sizes as determined in this section are specific to an average water depth of 5000~m and scale down at shallower depths. Additional tests at 500~m and 2000~m average water depth are shown in Figures~S7--S8 in the electronic supplement and demonstrate that uncertainties generally decrease with decreasing water depth, and thus uncertainties stated in this section represent upper bounds for the algorithm.
}\DIFaddend 

The resulting RMS misfits for each model parameter and survey type are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:survey_geom_explore}a--c. The most well-resolved parameter for all survey types is the horizontal location of the instrument on the seafloor, $r_{xy}$. With the exception of \textit{Line} \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and 1.5~Nm }\textit{\DIFadd{Circle}} \DIFaddend surveys, all survey types resolve horizontal location to within \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{100}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{50}\DIFaddend ~m. The \textit{Line} surveys fail to resolve the instrument location along the direction orthogonal to the ship track (RMS $\sim$700~m) but succeed in resolving its location parallel to the line (RMS $\sim$4~m). This is also shown in plots of model resolution (Figure~\ref{fig:resolution_correlation}), where model parameter $y$ is unresolved for a ship track parallel to the x-direction. The \textit{PACMAN} survey with radius \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{greater than }\DIFdelend 0.75--1~Nm \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{performs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{($\sim$9--12~km) and the 1~Nm }\textit{\DIFadd{Diamond}} \DIFadd{survey perform }\DIFaddend best with horizontal RMS misfits of $<$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4}\DIFaddend ~m. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Although the }\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}} \DIFadd{and }\textit{\DIFadd{Diamond}} \DIFadd{surveys perform nearly equally well in our synthetic test, we prefer the former since its quasi-circular pattern results in a smaller Doppler correction (i.e., the ship remains at a nearly constant radius from the instrument for most of the survey). }\DIFaddend The \textit{PACMAN} survey recovers the horizontal location to within 10~m even for a survey with radius of 0.5~Nm.

Horizontal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{misfit decreases as survey radiusincreases}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{instrument location is important for most applications, and its precision increases with survey radius}\DIFaddend . However, larger surveys require more time at each site and thus \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend are undesirable. The improvement in misfit with increasing survey \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{radius }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{size }\DIFaddend saturates at large radius, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this }\DIFaddend diminishing return can be quantified by a trade-off parameter, $\lambda$, defined as the product between \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{survey radius }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{total survey length }\DIFaddend and horizontal misfit, $\delta r_{xy}$ (Figure~\ref{fig:survey_geom_explore}d). \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The ideal survey radius corresponding to a minimum in this parameter occurs at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Assuming constant ship speed, minimizing this parameter is equivalent to mutually minimizing survey duration and horizontal location error.

\subsection{\DIFadd{Application to PacificArray deployment}} \label{sec:PacificArray_deployment}
\DIFadd{We applied the location algorithm to acoustic surveys carried out during the Young Pacific ORCA deployment in the central Pacific ocean during April and May of 2018 \mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\citep{Gaherty2018}}%DIFAUXCMD
. The OBS array comprised 30 SIO broadband instruments each equipped with a Model ITC-3013 transponder and deployed from the R/V Kilo Moana in water depths of $\sim$4400-4800 m. Acoustic  surveys were carried out using an EdgeTech 8011M Acoustic Transceiver command and ranging unit, attached to a hull-mounted 12 kHz transducer. A GPS-transponder offset is not known, and therefore no correction is applied. The relatively calm seas allowed for ideal survey geometry at almost all sites, with a ship speed of \mbox{$\le$8~knots} at a maximum radius of \mbox{$\sim$1.3~Nm}. 
}

\DIFadd{An example station inversion, as well as the graphical outputs of the location software, is shown in Figures \ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}-\ref{fig:one_sta_real_ftests}. Ship velocity is estimated from the survey data by differencing neighboring survey points. In theory, this could be used to correct Doppler shifts (Figure \ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}c) in travel time (as in the synthetic tests), but we found that this correction did not substantially improve data fit for real stations and so did not apply it to this data set, although it is included as an option in the location codes. Furthermore, the ray-bending corrections, $\delta T_{\text{bend}}$, are negligible ($<$0.01~ms) at these water depths (see Figures~S1--S2, available in the electronic supplement to this article) and change the estimated horizontal location, depth, and water velocity by less than 0.2~m, }\DIFaddend 0.5\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{--0.75~Nm. 
Of these alternative survey configurations, the }\textit{\DIFdel{Diamond}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{performs best. However, for the same radius of 1~Nm, the }\textit{\DIFdel{PACMAN}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{survey yields the lowest RMS misfits, outperforming all other geometries tested. Therefore, the }\textit{\DIFdel{PACMAN}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{survey pattern with radius 0.75--1~Nm is the optimal geometry for accurately locating instruments on the seafloor. Even with $\tau$ varying from the assumed value of 13~ms, we were able to resolve all parameters with high precision, suggesting that the inversion is robust to uncertainties in turn-around time less than }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~m, and 0.3~m/s, respectively; thus, we choose not to apply the ray-bending correction here. The small RMS data misfit of }\DIFaddend $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3~ms. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.6~ms attests to the quality of the survey measurements and the appropriateness of our relatively simple location algorithm (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}d). The southwestwards drift of \mbox{$\sim340$~m} (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_real_histograms}) demonstrates that ocean currents can substantially displace the final OBS location from the surface drop point. The F-test 95\% confidence bounds are 5--6~m in the horizontal directions and 10--12~m in depth (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_real_ftests}).

%DIF <  - Mean signed error (MSE): Tells us about bias in the inversion; Zero means there's no bias. They are ~0 for for all surveys except PACMAN0.1, PACMAN0.5, Circle, and Line (Actually circle 0.5 Nm isn't too bad for some reason). Largest tradeoffs are for depth (~100 m) and water velocity (~25 m/s) for circle arrays with opposite signs indicating tradeoffs (see Figure~7). Also significant biases in the mean for line surveys in y (100-200 m) and z (~60 m), but they don't appear to trade off.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The 30 stations in this array drifted an average distance of 170 m. The mean data RMS misfit was 1.96 ms and the estimated 95th percentile horizontal location error based on the bootstrap analysis was 1.13 m. The water depth estimated by the inversion was systematically shallower than that measured using the shipboard multibeam instrument, differing by an average value of 18.6 m. Assuming the multibeam depths, which are computed using a water sound speed profile that is validated daily by XBT measurements, are correct, this discrepancy indicates that the inversion systematically overestimates sound speed slightly (see Section~4).

%DIF <  - MAE increases with the increasing variance of error.
%DIF <  MAE = RMS for uniformly distributed errors (all errors are the same), otherwise RMS > MAE
%DIF <  RMS/MAE > 1 signifies outliers. The larger the ratio, the more outliers (think about using this ratio?)
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Without accurate seafloor corroboration from an ROV, it is not possible to directly verify the locations of stations within the Pacific ORCA array. However, we  obtain indirect support for the success of the location algorithm by considering the drift of all stations within this array (Figure~\ref{fig:meso_eddy}). Taken together, the direction and magnitude of drift depicts a pattern of clockwise rotation with a minimum diameter of $\sim$500 km. This pattern is consistent with a meso-scale cyclonic gyre, with a direction, location, and approximate size that is consonant with large-scale patterns of geostrophic flow observed in this location roughly within the time frame of the deployment (see Figure~S10, available in the electronic supplement to this article). The fact that we are able to discern this pattern from our estimated locations is a testament to the accuracy of the }\textit{\DIFadd{OBSrange}} \DIFadd{algorithm. This observation also raises the intriguing possibility of using OBS instruments as ad hoc depth-integrated flow meters for the oceans.

\section{Discussion }
A reliable tool for accurately locating instruments on the seafloor is paramount, given the growing number of ocean bottom deployments. We present the first such open-source OBS locator code that is freely available to the scientific community. One of the primary features of the tool is its ability to provide robust confidence bounds on the 3D instrument position on the seafloor, which will inform recovery cruise efforts as well as provide accurate station metadata\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, upon }\DIFaddend which essentially all seismic analyses rely\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{on}\DIFdelend . Furthermore, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this article represents }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{we have performed }\DIFaddend the first systematic exploration of survey geometries that we are aware of, which will help streamline future OBS deployments.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{At $\sim$5000~m water depth, most survey geometries recover depth and average sound speed velocity equally well. However, the }\DIFaddend \textit{PACMAN} survey \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{geometry }\DIFdelend with a radius of $\sim$1~Nm \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is optimal for accurately recovering }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sufficiently recovers }\DIFaddend all model parameters in the synthetic tests (Figure~\ref{fig:survey_geom_explore}), including \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the depth-water velocity trade-off. Typical horizontal locations errors for such a configuration are on the order of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$z$ and $V_p$ to within 10~m and 3~m/s, respectively, and horizontal location to within }\DIFaddend $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{4}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3}\DIFaddend ~m. A radius of 0.75~Nm is sufficient for accurate horizontal \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{location }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{locations }\DIFaddend (to within $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{5}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{4}\DIFaddend ~m) but with increased \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{RMS error }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{uncertainty }\DIFaddend in instrument depth and water velocity. However, the smaller 0.75~Nm radius survey reduces the total survey duration by $\sim$25\% compared to the 1~Nm survey ($\sim$38~min compared to $\sim$50~min for an average ship velocity of 8~kn). If depth \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{/}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and water }\DIFaddend velocity estimates are of lesser importance and/or time is limited, the smaller 0.75~Nm radius may be desirable. A survey radius larger than 1~Nm is likely not warranted, requiring more ship time at each site for little improvement in misfit. Additionally, failed acoustic returns are more likely to occur at greater distances from the instrument, resulting in data gaps which will negatively impact the inversion. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Some ship captains prefer only to steam along straight lines; in such cases, the }\textit{\DIFadd{Diamond}} \DIFadd{survey with 1~Nm radius is a viable alternative, given its comparable performance to the }\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}} \DIFadd{geometry (Figure~\ref{fig:survey_geom_explore}a--c). }\DIFaddend The radial legs of the survey where the ship travels toward and away from the instrument are crucial for resolving the depth-velocity trade-off. For this reason, the \textit{Circle} configuration cannot independently resolve depth and water velocity and should be avoided.

The \textit{Line} geometry warrants additional discussion as it is commonly used for locating OBS during active-source experiments because it is often the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fastest method. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{simplest pattern. Parallel to the line, the instrument location is resolved quite well (to within $\sim$4~m). }\DIFaddend However, the instrument location perpendicular to the line cannot be resolved. This is evident from the resolution matrix as well as the synthetic bootstrap tests. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{However, parallel to the line the instrument location is resolved quite well (to within $\sim$4~m). }\DIFdelend The instrument depth is also poorly resolved with RMS of $\sim$200~m. In order to resolve both horizontal dimensions \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and depth}\DIFaddend , an alternative survey geometry with a range of ship-track azimuths \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{should }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(or even two perpendicular lines crossing the instrument, such as the }\textit{\DIFadd{Cross}} \DIFadd{or }\textit{\DIFadd{Hourglass}} \DIFadd{geometry) may }\DIFaddend be used.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Optimal survey size scales down with decreasing water depth. Figures~S7--S8 in the electronic supplement show the synthetic tests from Section~\ref{sec:surv_geom_tests} at 2000~m and 500~m. The optimal survey radius shrinks to 0.5~Nm at 2000~m water depth and 0.25~Nm at 500~m depth. Uncertainties decrease with decreasing water depth at the preferred survey radius as well as overall. This decrease in optimal survey size has implications for ray bending corrections in shallow water. Deviations from the straight ray approximation occur most strongly in shallow water at large offsets, especially if there is an abrupt drop in velocity at the thermocline (see Figures~S1, available in the electronic supplement to this article). However, the small optimal survey size at shallow water depth means large offsets are never reached, reducing the importance of ray bending even at shallow depths. For instance, at 0.25~Nm offset for 500~m water depth the perturbation to the travel time is only $\sim$0.06~ms, significantly lower than experimental noise, even with the presence of an abrupt thermocline.
}

\DIFaddend Observations of instrument drift from seasurface to seafloor are byproducts of the location algorithm if instrument drop points are precisely recorded. Figure~\ref{fig:meso_eddy} highlights both the precision of the \textit{OBSrange} algorithm as well as the potential for using instrument drift as an oceanographic observation. A clockwise rotation pattern \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is observed }\DIFdelend in instrument drift \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is observed }\DIFaddend across the Young Pacific ORCA network that is consistent with a large cyclonic mesoscale feature, providing novel point measurements of depth-integrated flow through the water column that could be used to calibrate models of the vertical shear (Ryan Abernathey, \textit{pers. comm.}). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Although there are certainly higher resolution methods of measuring shallow-most characteristics of the water column, such as using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP), observations tracking from the surface to seafloor may still prove useful. }\DIFaddend With the further proliferation of seafloor data providing broader spatial and temporal sampling, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{measurements }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data }\DIFaddend such as these could be used to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{estimate }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{verify models of }\DIFaddend vertical structure of the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{full }\DIFaddend water column. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Furthermore, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend network-wide depth-averaged water velocity is $\sim$1505~m\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/s }\DIFaddend with standard deviation $\sim$4.5~m\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{/s}\DIFaddend , consistent with the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{regional }\DIFaddend decadal average for the month of April ($\sim$1509~m/s) from the 2009 World Ocean \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Database }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Atlas database }\DIFaddend (see Data and Resources).

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Accounting for a relative offset between the shipboard GPS and transponder may be important for correctly resolving depth and average sound speed for some combinations of survey geometry and GPS-transponder offset. The synthetic test in Section~\ref{sec:Comparison_to_previous_tools} shows that if the transponder and GPS are offset by $\sim$14~m and the survey pattern is such that the transponder is systematically positioned further than the GPS from the instrument by $\sim$2.5~m (in 3-dimensions), $z$ may be underestimated by as much as $\sim$28~m. This bias may explain the $\sim$18.6~m shallowing of stations at Young Pacific ORCA compared to depths reported by the shipboard multibeam, where a GPS-transponder offset was not known and no correction was applied. Figure~S9 in the electronic supplement shows results for the same synthetic tests from Section~\ref{sec:surv_geom_tests} without the GPS-transponder correction applied. While the }\textit{\DIFadd{PACMAN}} \DIFadd{survey still performs best at recovering horizontal location, it poorly recovers depth and water velocity. However, anti-symmetric patterns (i.e. having both clockwise and counter-clockwise segments and ship tracks toward and away from the instrument) such as }\textit{\DIFadd{Hourglass}} \DIFadd{and }\textit{\DIFadd{Cross2}} \DIFadd{accurately recover $z$ and $V_p$ by effectively canceling the offset anomaly along the anti-symmetric legs. The specific configuration of the GPS-transponder offset relative to the chosen survey pattern dictates the impact of not correcting the travel times for such an offset. For example, if the GPS and transponder were located at the front and back of the ship, respectively, the circular legs of the survey would be unbiased, with large biases along the radial legs. If the GPS-transponder offset cannot be determined before an experiment and accurate depth and sound speed are desired, an anti-symmetric survey pattern with clockwise/counter-clockwise and radial legs toward/away from the instrument may be used with a slight reduction in horizontal precision.
}

\DIFaddend We find that the Doppler travel-time corrections \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{only slightly improve RMS misfit }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{improve RMS travel-time misfit by only $\sim$0.3~ms ($\sim$7\% reduction) }\DIFaddend for the synthetic \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tests }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{test }\DIFaddend (Figure~\ref{fig:compare_tool}) and do not improve \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{RMS }\DIFaddend misfit for the real data. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, the test shows a reduction in horizontal errors of $\sim$2~m ($\sim$40\%) when using the correction, and therefore, we include the Doppler correction as an option in the code. }\DIFaddend One possible reason why the corrections fail to improve the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{travel-time }\DIFaddend misfit for real data may simply be the inability to accurately estimate ship velocity resulting from poor GPS spatial precision and/or poor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{spatial-temporal }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{spatiotemporal }\DIFaddend sampling along the ship tracks, especially when large data gaps are present. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Additionally, the algorithm does not include a travel-time correction to account for a possible offset in the GPS receiver and the acoustic transponder relative to the instrument (i.e. it is assumed that they are colocated) . Let us consider a worst-case scenario where the GPS and transponder are at opposite ends of the ship and one is closer to the instrument by $\sim$30~m. For a 1~Nm radius survey with the instrument at 5~km depth, the travel-time difference due to the separation would be $\sim$14~ms.
However, for quasi-circular geometries such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend \textit{PACMAN} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, this timing error will be static around the perimeter of the circle effecting primarily the depth and water velocity; Thus, it should not significantly effect the estimated horizontal instrument location.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{survey pattern is quasi-circular and therefore the Doppler correction is quite small ($<$2~ms) along the majority of the survey (Figure~\ref{fig:one_sta_real_survey}c).

\section{Conclusion }
We present \textit{OBSrange}, a new open-source tool for robustly locating OBS on the seafloor. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Two-way travel times }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Acoustic ranging two-way travel-time data }\DIFaddend between the ship and OBS are inverted for horizontal instrument position, instrument depth\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, }\DIFaddend and depth-averaged water \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{velocity. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{sound speed. Our algorithm can account for travel time perturbations due to ship motion between sending and receiving, ray bending through the water column, and a static offset between the GPS and transponder. }\DIFaddend Uncertainties are calculated for all four parameters using bootstrap resampling, and an F-test grid search provides a 3D confidence ellipsoid around the station. The tool is validated using a synthetic travel-time dataset yielding typical horizontal location errors on the order of $\sim$4~m \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for 5000~m water depth}\DIFaddend . Various survey geometries are explored through synthetic tests, and we find that the \textit{PACMAN} survey configuration \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is most successful at recovering horizontal location, even with an unaccounted for GPS-transponder offset. Optimal survey radius depends on water depth and desired precision ranging from 0.75--1~Nm at 5000~m water depth to }\DIFaddend $\sim$\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1~Nm radius is the optimal geometry for robustly recovering the true instrument position while minimizing the trade-off between depth and water velocity}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{0.25~Nm at 500~m depth}\DIFaddend . The \textit{Circle} configuration is unable to resolve depth and water velocity and should be avoided. The \textit{Line} survey pattern, commonly used in short-period OBS deployments, recovers instrument location parallel to the line but has no resolution in the orthogonal direction. If instrument depth and/or water velocity are of particular importance, a survey pattern such as \textit{PACMAN} is desirable, which contains long ship tracks toward and away from the instrument. If \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{GPS-transponder offset is uncertain and cannot be measured, the }\textit{\DIFadd{Cross2}} \DIFadd{or }\textit{\DIFadd{Hourglass}} \DIFadd{patterns provide the best resolution of }\DIFaddend depth and water velocity\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are of lesser importance and/or time is restricted, a }\textit{\DIFdel{PACMAN}} %DIFAUXCMD

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Young Pacific ORCA }\DIFaddend deployment yielding an average RMS data misfit of 1.96~ms and revealing a clockwise-rotation pattern in the instrument drifts with a diameter of $\sim$500~km that correlates with a cyclonic mesoscale feature. This observation further demonstrates the precision of \textit{OBSrange} and suggests the possibility of utilizing instrument drift data as an oceanographic tool for estimating depth-integrated flow through the water column.
