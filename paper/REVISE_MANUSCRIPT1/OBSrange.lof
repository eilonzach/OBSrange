\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Schematic of the acoustic ranging procedure. A 12\nobreakspace {}kHz acoustic pulse is sent from ship to OBS. After a time $\tau $, the OBS returns the acoustic signal to the ship at its new position. The difference in these send- and receive-times is referred to as the \textit {``Doppler''} correction, $\delta T$. From this schematic, it is clear that only ship tracks traveling toward or away from the instrument will result in a non-zero $\delta T$.}}{27}{figure.1}

A comparison of the true input values (green star and lines) with the inverted model parameters (red circle and red solid lines) demonstrates that the location, depth, and water velocity are extremely well recovered, and the estimated uncertainties on these parameters are consonant with the actual misfit. Top three plots show slices through the F-test surface, contoured by probability. Bottom two plots show histograms from a bootstrap analysis with 95th percentile values indicated by dashed red lines. Inset shows the direction of true (green dashed) and estimated (red) drift with respect to the starting location. }}{28}{figure.2}
