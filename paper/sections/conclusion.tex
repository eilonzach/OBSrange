We present \textit{OBSrange}, a new open-source tool for accurately locating OBS on the seafloor. Two-way travel time soundings are inverted for horizontal instrument position, instrument depth, average water velocity, and turn-around time. To validate the tool, we apply it to a synthetic dataset and compare its accuracy with a previous tool. Various survey geometries and are explored through synthetic bootstrap tests. We find that a \textit{``PACMAN''} style survey configuration with $\sim$1~Nm radius is the optimal geometry for robustly recovering the true instrument position while minimizing the trade off between depth and water velocity.

%- provide uncertainties
%- PACMAN geometry is best
%- Circle is worst
%- Line test can't resolve orthogonal direction
%- Turn-around time is not well resolved

%The circle geometry

%To demonstrate its utility,  is applied to synthetic and real datasets, compared with a previous tool, and used to investigate optimal survey geometries for accurate model parameter recovery. Bootstrap and F-test uncertainties are reported, providing exceptional measures of uncertainty. The tool is validated using a synthetic dataset
