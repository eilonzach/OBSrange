\caption{Test of location algorithm using synthetic data. A comparison of the true input values (green star and lines) with the inverted model parameters (red circle and red solid lines) demonstrates that the location, depth, and water velocity are extremely well recovered, and the estimated uncertainties on these parameters are consonant with the actual misfit. Top three plots show slices through the F-test surface, contoured by probability. Bottom three plots show histograms from a bootstrap analysis with 95th percentile values indicated by dashed red lines. Inset shows the direction of true (green dashed) and estimated (red) drift with respect to the starting location. }

Red solid line shows mean value, while dashed lines indicate 95th percentiles. Latitude and longitude are plotted in meters from the mean point, for ease of interpretation. The inset plot shows the mean drift azimuth from the drop location (grey square).}

White contours show 68\% and 95\% contours. Black dots show individual locations from the bootstrap analysis (Figure \ref{fig:one_sta_real_histograms}). }

Note that drift arrows are not to geographic scale. The systematic pattern of drift within the water column seems to be related to a meso-scale ocean eddy moving through this region during the deployment. Station symbol sizes are inversely scaled to acoustic travel time data misfit (see inset).}

\caption{ Synthetic test of OBSrange performance (gray symbols) compared with the SIO tool (red symbols) for a \textit{PACMAN} survey of radius 1 Nm. a) Map view comparing the OBSrange and SIO inverted instrument locations with the true location in green. Black contours show the 68\% and 95\% confidence from the OBSrange F-test. b) Two-way travel time (TWT) residuals for both methods as a function of ship azimuth from the true station location. c) TWT and d--g) model parameter RMS misfits for 9 inversions, where closed symbols represent parameters that are solved for in the inversion and open symbols are parameters that remain fixed throughout the inversion. The horizontal instrument location misfit is given by $\delta r_{xy} = \sqrt{\delta x_{O}^2 + \delta y_{O}^2} $. Stars in c--g mark the inversions shown in a) and b). See table~\ref{table:compare_tool} for details of each inversion.}

\caption{ Model parameter RMS misfits for 6 synthetic survey geometries of varying radii: \textit{PACMAN}, circle, cross, diamond, line, and triangle. Each survey geometry is shown to the left of its respective legend entry. The left column shows the mean misfit and right column show the RMS misfit for each model parameter for 10,000 synthetic survey realizations for each survey type, where horizontal instrument location misfit is given by $\delta r_{xy} = \sqrt{\delta x_{O}^2 + \delta y_{O}^2} $. We find that model parameters are most accurately recovered using the \textit{PACMAN} survey pattern with radius $\geq$1 Nm, and the line surveys perform worst. }
