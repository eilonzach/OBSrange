Each figure in the paper has its own directory and make script. 
These should be self-contained, so all data required for each figure is in
the directory for that figure. This way we can always re-create figures in 
future even if paths change etc.. Important for reproducibility. 

This folder contains all the data and MATLAB scripts to make 
each of the figures in the paper

Contents:

Figure1-X = folders containing scripts and any 
	      data required to plot each of the 
	      figures in the paper
