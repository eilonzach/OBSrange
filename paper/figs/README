Each figure in the paper has its own directory and make script. 
These should be self-contained, so all data required for each figure is in
the directory for that figure. This way we can always re-create figures in 
future even if paths change etc.. Important for reproducibility. 

This folder contains all the data and MATLAB scripts to make 
each of the figures in the paper

Contents:

make_all_figs.m = wrapper script to execute all of the functions that make 
                  each figure, so all figures can be re-made in bulk
figdata     = folder containing any data required to plot each of the 
	          figures in the paper
makeFigures = folder containing the individual scripts to make each of the 
              figures
Figure*.pdf = the image files for the figures... obviously.
