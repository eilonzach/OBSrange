The authors thank the captain, crew, and engineers of the R/V Kilo Moana who made the deployment possible as well as the Scripps Institution of Oceanography engineers on board the vessel who provided the OBS and whose expertise contributed greatly to the success of the Young Pacific ORCA deployment. This work was supported by NSF grant OCE-1658214 (Z. Eilon) as well as an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship DGE-16-44869 (J.B. Russell). The authors additionally thank Ernest Aaron for key conversations on the acoustic equipment as well as sharing the SIO location code written by Paul Georgief, Ryan P. Abernathey for guidance interpreting instrument drift in relation to ocean dynamics, and William Menke for insightful conversations on model resolution in the presence of prior constraints.
