As the marine geophysics community continues to instrument the seafloor, data quality and easy instrument recoverability rely on accurate estimations of the instrument locations on the ocean floor. However, freely-available software for this estimation does not currently exist. We present \textit{OBSrange}, an open-source tool for robustly locating ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) on the seafloor. Available in both MATLAB and Python, the algorithm inverts acoustic ranging two-way travel time data for instrument position, depth, and average water velocity. The tool provides comprehensive estimates of model parameter uncertainty including bootstrap uncertainties for all four parameters as well as an F-test grid search that provides a 3D confidence ellipsoid around each station. We validate the tool using a synthetic travel-time dataset and find average horizontal location errors on the order of $\sim$4~m. An exploration of survey geometries shows that the so-called \textit{``PACMAN''} style survey pattern of radius 1~Nm with long ship-tracks towards and away from the instrument is optimal for resolving all parameters, including the trade-off between depth and water velocity. A radius of 0.75~Nm is optimal for accurate horizontal locations. However, \textit{Circle} and \textit{Line} surveys have undesirable trade-offs and should be avoided, if possible. We apply our tool to the 2018 \textit{Young Pacific ORCA} deployment in the south Pacific and observe an average RMS data misfit of 1.96~ms. We observe instrument drifts of 170~m on average that form a clockwise-rotation pattern of $\sim$500~km diameter that resembles a cyclonic mesoscale feature, suggesting a potential use for instrument drifts as a proxy for depth-integrated flow through the water column.
