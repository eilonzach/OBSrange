\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces Schematic of the acoustic ranging procedure for a \textit {PACMAN} survey pattern. The instrument drop point (OBS drop) is treated as the origin and initial model for the inversion. The OBS is then free to drift as it descends to the seafloor (OBS drift). A 12\nobreakspace {}kHz acoustic pulse is sent from ship to OBS, and after a processing time $\tau $, the OBS returns a pulse to the ship. Meanwhile, the ship has moved from its initial position (send) to its receiving position (exaggerated for illustrative purposes). The difference in these send- and receive-times is referred to as the ``Doppler'' correction, $\delta T_{\text {dopp}}$, in the text. From this schematic, it is clear that ship tracks traveling toward or away from the instrument will result in the largest Doppler times.}}{24}{figure.1}

The green star denotes the true location. b-c) Histograms from a bootstrap analysis with the median shown by the solid red line, 95th percentile values indicated by dashed red lines, and the true value in green. Inset shows the direction of true (green dashed) and estimated (red) drift with respect to the starting location. d-f) Slices through the F-test surface with white lines showing 68\% and 95\% confidence. Symbols are the same as (a). Comparison of the true input values with the inverted model parameters demonstrates that the location, depth, and water velocity are extremely well recovered, and the estimated uncertainties on these parameters are consonant with the actual misfit.}}{25}{figure.2}

Blue filled circles represent \textit {PACMAN} surveys ranging from 0.1--1.5\nobreakspace {}Nm. \textit {Circle} surveys (blue open circles) are of radius 0.5\nobreakspace {}Nm, 1\nobreakspace {}Nm, and 1.5\nobreakspace {}Nm. All other surveys (black and gray symbols) are at 1\nobreakspace {}Nm radius. The ``optimal'' \textit {PACMAN} survey is circled in red (see d). a--c) RMS model parameter misfits for each survey type with respect to total survey length: \textit {PACMAN}, \textit {Circle}, \textit {Cross}, \textit {Line}, \textit {Triangle}, \textit {Diamond}, \textit {Hourglass}, and \textit {Cardinal} where \textit {Cardinal} comprises multiples pings overhead and at 4 cardinal points. Each survey geometry is shown to the right of its respective legend entry. Horizontal instrument location misfit is again given by $\delta r_{xy} = \sqrt {\delta x^2 + \delta y^2} $. Dashed lines for \textit {Line} surveys denote misfit in the direction running parallel to the line ($x$-direction for these tests). Arrows denote symbols which extend beyond the axis bounds. d) Quantification of diminishing improvement as radius of \textit {PACMAN} survey is increased, where $\lambda $ is the product between survey radius and $\delta r_{xy}$. The lowest ``optimal'' value of $\lambda $ occurs at a radius of 0.75\nobreakspace {}Nm (circled in red). e) Change in the rate of improvement of horizontal location misfit with increasing \textit {PACMAN} survey radius ($\nabla r_{xy}$), where the red dashed line indicates minimum $\lambda $ (see Figure\nobreakspace {}S6, available in the electronic supplement to this article). Improvements in horizontal misfit become small as radius increases beyond 0.75--1\nobreakspace {}Nm.}}{27}{figure.4}
